# Isle Joshua - Browser Game

This was a fun little project that I've meant to do for a long time. It was really a test of "vibe-coding" to see if I could create something I've always meant to create, but didn't want to set aside the time for. I did this between things, on lunch breaks, when I was boiling the kettle on the weekends, etc. It didn't take up much time, but it was really fun to build and work with.

The core idea is to have a browser-based Zelda-like game for my personal website.
